This application presents a user-friendly shopping list in which a list of groceries and the required quantity of that grocery can be built. In the list you can mark "V" when you picked up the product at the grocery store and the product will be marked accordingly. You can edit the name of the block / quantity according to your wish or delete it from the list. The list can be saved by local storage.
